## User Preferences
I prefer detailed explanations. Do not make changes to the folder Z. Do not make changes to the file Y.

## System Architecture
The system employs a multi-tiered architecture focusing on modularity and scalability.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
The dashboard is built with Streamlit and features a professional, responsive design with automatic dark/light mode detection. It utilizes a corporate color palette and presents all content in professional Spanish, including contextual descriptions, KPI explanations, and actionable recommendations. Key elements include interactive visualizations with Plotly, professional tab navigation, and executive insights generation based on real-time data. Visual consistency is maintained through standardized formatting and clear labels.

**Technical Implementations & Feature Specifications:**

*   **Interactive Dashboard (Streamlit):** Features 9 functional navigation tabs for comprehensive analysis: General Summary, Geography, Forecasting, Products, Customers, Channel, ML & AI, Finance, and Operations. Includes 8 core KPIs, geo-spatial analysis with Folium, Prophet-based 90-day forecasting, BCG matrix for product analysis, RFM customer segmentation with K-Means clustering, Sankey diagrams, Isolation Forest for anomaly detection, and waterfall charts for financial P&L. All data, filters, labels, and insights are fully translated into Spanish.
*   **API RESTful (FastAPI):** Provides data and machine learning endpoints for KPIs, transactions, customers, products, aggregated analytics, forecasting, clustering, churn prediction, product recommendations, and anomaly detection. Includes endpoints for generating comprehensive Excel and PDF reports.
*   **Database Design (Unified Parquet + PostgreSQL):** Primary data source is optimized Parquet files (774,434 transactions from 2010-2025), supplemented by PostgreSQL for development and backup. Data includes 541,909 real and 232,525 synthetically generated transactions, ensuring continuous time series and realistic distributions. Optimized indexing supports rapid query performance.
*   **Internationalization System:** Comprehensive translation architecture ensures a 100% Spanish interface across all UI elements, data, charts, tooltips, and insights, applied automatically at data load time.

  - **PROBLEM ELIMINATED:** Removed problematic text that didn't format correctly ("Sisemantieneestendencia")
  - **SOLUTION:** Made chart completely self-explanatory without text dependencies
  - **Chart improvements:**
    * Layering order: Tendencia (background) → Histórico (main) → Proyección (forecast)
    * Trend line: Blue dashed with opacity 0.6 for subtle reference
    * Historical: Green solid line (width 4, marker size 8) - prominently displayed
    * Projection: Orange dotted line (width 3, diamond markers size 10) - clearly differentiated
    * **Perfect connection:** Projection starts exactly where historical ends (shared point)
    * Height increased: 400→450px for better visibility
    * Horizontal legend at top to maximize chart space
  - Result: Clean, professional, executive-ready visualization without text formatting issues

- ✅ Architect review: PASS on all corrections

**Dashboard v3.5 - Product Analysis Data Coherence (October 26, 2025):**

- ✅ **Data Coherence Issue Resolved:**
  - **PROBLEM:** Top 20 products and Top 15 rotation charts showed "Manual", "POSTAGE", "DOTCOM POSTAGE" as dominant products, distorting real product hierarchy
  - **ROOT CAUSE:** These are generic/shipping cost entries, not actual products - they appeared across all categories inflating rankings
  - **SOLUTION:** Implemented consistent product filtering across all product visualizations
  
- ✅ **Product Filtering System:**
  - Excluded non-significant products: ['Manual', 'POSTAGE', 'DOTCOM POSTAGE', 'Adjust bad debt', 'BANK CHARGES']
  - Applied to 4 visualizations:
    1. Top 20 Products by Revenue (app.py lines 799-825)
    2. Top 15 Most Purchased Products by Quantity [NEW] (app.py lines 827-848)
    3. Top 15 Products by Rotation Velocity (app.py lines 1835-1864)
    4. BCG Matrix Product Performance (app.py lines 895-898)
  - Result: Now shows real products like "REGENCY CAKESTAND 3 TIER", "PICNIC BASKET WICKER SMALL", "VINTAGE BLUE KITCHEN CABINET"

- ✅ **Enhanced Visualizations:**
  - Added 'category' column to all product aggregations (Top 20, Top 15 comprados, Top 15 rotación)
  - Changed color encoding from metric values to categories (using Set2 palette) across all 3 charts
  - Updated titles with "(excl. envíos)" for transparency
  - Fixed hovertemplate warnings by using `custom_data` instead of `marker.color`
  - Hovers now show: Product name + Category + Primary metric + Secondary metric
  - **NEW:** Added "Top 15 Productos Más Comprados" visualization showing products by quantity sold

- ✅ **Mathematical Coherence Verified:**
  - **Category hierarchy (global):** Home 28%, Fashion 16%, Electronics 16%, Groceries 12%
  - **Top 20 by revenue:** Home 45%, Electronics 20%, Fashion 20%, Groceries 10%
  - **Top 15 most purchased:** Home 80%, Groceries 13%, Fashion 7%
  - **Top 15 by rotation:** Home 73%, Groceries 13%, Fashion 13%
  - All visualizations now respect and reflect the dominant categories consistently
  - Electronics dominates in revenue but not in quantity (expected: high-value products)

**Technical Quality:**
- ✅ Dashboard running without errors
- ✅ Zero hovertemplate warnings (previously 5+ warnings)
- ✅ Category-to-product hierarchy mathematically consistent across 4 visualizations
- ✅ Executive-ready data integrity across all product analytics
- ✅ Only pre-existing Plotly country names notice (non-blocking)
- ✅ **VALIDATED FOR INTERNATIONAL CLIENT DELIVERY**

**Dashboard v3.6 - Prophet Forecasting Fix (October 26, 2025):**

- ✅ **Prophet Timestamp Error RESOLVED (FINAL):**
  - **PROBLEM:** "Addition/subtraction of integers and integer-arrays with Timestamp is no longer supported. Instead of adding/subtracting n, use n * obj.freq"
  - **ROOT CAUSE:** Prophet's `make_future_dataframe()` required explicit frequency specification for different granularities
  - **SOLUTION:** Implemented granularity-specific frequency mapping that maintains ~90 day forecast window
  
- ✅ **Frequency Mapping Implementation:**
  - **Día:** 90 periods × freq='D' = 90 days
  - **Semana:** 13 periods × freq='W-MON' = ~91 days (Monday-start weeks)
  - **Mes:** 3 periods × freq='MS' = ~90 days (Month-start)
  - Code location: app.py lines 629-642
  - Uses `math.ceil()` for period calculations to ensure complete coverage
  
- ✅ **Technical Improvements:**
  - Explicit frequencies (D, W-MON, MS) align with historical data aggregation
  - Preserves UI contract: "forecasting 90 days" regardless of granularity
  - Prevents datetime alignment errors across all three time scales
  
- ✅ **Validation:**
  - Prophet executing successfully across all granularities (cmdstanpy logs confirm)
  - No Timestamp errors in production
  - Forecast plots rendering correctly with expected horizon length
  - Architect review: PASS

**Technical Quality:**
- ✅ Dashboard running without errors
- ✅ Prophet forecasting stable across all granularities (Día/Semana/Mes)
- ✅ Zero Timestamp errors
- ✅ Client/executive-ready presentation
- ✅ Only pre-existing Plotly country names notice (non-blocking)
